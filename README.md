## About the project
This project follows the develepoment a control system for an USV. It consists of efficient code to read the PWM output of an RC receiver via Pin Change Interrupts and write PWM to the ESCs controlling underwater thrusters. LSM6DS3 IMU sensor is used as AHRS, while VL53L1X ToF distance sensors are used to maintain constant distance away from canal walls via PID algorithm.
