## About the project
Credits: kelvineyeone (Arduino Project Hub)
This project contains efficient code that can be used to read the PWM output of an RC receiver (on any digital pin of the ATmega328), and also apply a fail-safe in case of loss of the transmitter signal.
This code measures PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals using Pin Change interrupts.
